PyledTasks
==========
## Goal of the project ##
This project aims to produce basic (later on advanced) task management for PhD students and researchers.
## Techs and languages ##
Will most probably use Python (3) , with libs Kivy and Plyer
## Why the name ? ##
The Research world is very amused by a web comic called PhD Comics, where "PhD" stands for "Piled Higher and Deeper". Not to be too serious, I kept the "piled tasks" idea, with a pinch of python.
